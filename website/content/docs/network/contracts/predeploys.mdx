The Metis protocol consists of several contracts that are deployed on some specific addresses. The contracts have been deployed on L2, L1, Andromeda, and Metis Sepolia testnet. The [Metis Github page](https://github.com/MetisProtocol/mvm/tree/develop/packages/contracts/deployments) shows all the core predeployed contracts addresses.

[^1]: **BondManager** is a component responsible for managing and maintaining bonds or collateral deposits that are used to secure the network.

[^2]: The **CanonicalTransactionChain** is essentially the ordered list of transactions that have been submitted to the Layer 2 chain. It serves as the official record of all transactions that have been processed and included in the chain.

[^3]: The **ChainStorageContainer-CTC-batches** is a data structure that holds batches of transactions which are part of the CanonicalTransactionChain in Layer 2 solutions like Optimistic Rollups.

[^4]: The **ChainStorageContainer-CTC-queue** is a data structure designed to manage and temporarily store transactions that are waiting to be included in the next batch of the CanonicalTransactionChain (CTC).

[^5]: The **ChainStorageContainer-SCC-batches** is a data structure that holds batches of state commitments within a state commitment chain (SCC). These commitments represent the state of the Layer 2 chain at various points in time.

[^6]: The **L1StandardBridge** is a smart contract deployed on Layer 1 (Ethereum mainnet) that handles the transfer of assets (such as ETH and ERC20 tokens) and messages between Layer 1 and Layer 2. The "**for verification only**" aspect indicates that this bridge is also responsible for verifying the correctness of state transitions and transactions that occur on Layer 2.

[^7]: The **Lib_AddressManager** is a smart contract utility that serves as a registry for storing and managing addresses of key contracts and components in a Layer 2 solution. This central address management helps ensure that all components can easily locate and interact with each other.

[^8]: The **MVM_CanonicalTransaction_for_verification_only** is a specialized component or function designed to handle the verification of transactions within a CanonicalTransactionChain. This component ensures that transactions are valid and adhere to the rules and protocols established by the Layer 2 (L2) solution.

[^9]: The **MVM_DiscountOracle** is a service or smart contract that provides information about discounts or reduced transaction fees within the MetaMask Virtual Machine (MVM) or another blockchain-based ecosystem. This oracle supplies data that can be used to adjust the cost of operations dynamically.

[^10]: The **MVM_L2ChainManagerOnL1_for_verification_only** is a smart contract or a set of smart contracts on the Ethereum mainnet (Layer 1) that manages and verifies the state and transactions of the Layer 2 chain. This component is focused solely on verification tasks to ensure the integrity and correctness of the L2 chain from the L1 perspective.

[^11]: The **MVM_StateCommitmentChain_for_verification_only** is a specialized module or smart contract that manages and verifies state commitments on the Metis Layer 2 (L2) chain. It is responsible for recording cryptographic commitments to the state of the L2 chain and ensuring these commitments are valid and secure.

[^12]: The **MVM_Verifier** is a smart contract or a module within the Metis Virtual Machine (MVM) dedicated to verifying the accuracy and integrity of transactions, state transitions, and other operations within the Layer 2 (L2) chain.

[^13]: The **MVM_Verifier_for_verification_only** is a component within the Metis Virtual Machine that exclusively handles the verification of transactions and state transitions. Its purpose is to ensure the validity and integrity of these operations, playing a crucial role in the security and reliability of the Metis Layer 2 chain.

[^14]: The **OVM_L1CrossDomainMessenger** is a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum mainnet (L1) that handles the sending and receiving of messages between Layer 1 and Layer 2. This component is essential for enabling cross-domain interactions, allowing contracts and users on L1 to communicate with contracts and users on L2.

[^15]: The **SCC contract** is a smart contract deployed on the L1 blockchain that records and manages cryptographic commitments to the state of the L2 chain. It plays a vital role in anchoring the L2 state to L1, ensuring security and verifiability.
