By following these guidelines, Sequencers can efficiently claim rewards, increase or withdraw their lock-up amounts, and avoid penalties while contributing to the security and stability of the Metis network.

<Callout type="info">
  There are some prerequisites to running a sequencer. See
  [Requirements](/sequencer/operation/requirements) for more details.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step>

## Set Up and Run Your Node

Follow the provided technical documentation to deploy and initialize your Sequencer node:

**Initialization**:

1. Install and configure [Docker Compose](https://github.com/ericlee42/metis-sequencer-setup-docker-compose) or [Kubernetes](https://github.com/MetisProtocol/metis-charts/blob/main/README.md) on your server.
2. Run the Sequencer node setup script:
   - Generate the Sequencer address, private key, and public key during initialization.
3. Back up your private key securely. Loss of the key may result in irrecoverable consequences.

**Configuration**:

- Deploy your node as instructed in the README file using Docker Compose or Kubernetes.
- Ensure your private key address is backed up, and generate a local private key file for secure storage.

</Step>

<Step>

## Submit Sequencer Information

Submit your node's details via a GitHub pull request for inclusion in the Metis Decentralized Sequencer Dashboard.

**Required Information**:

- **Name**: Name of your Sequencer.
- **Avatar**: A profile image/logo.
- **URL**: Your organization's website.
- **Address**: The whitelist address for sequencer lock-up.
- **Seq_addr**: The sequencer address provided by the server after you run the Sequencer.
- **Pubkey**: The public key provided by the server after you run the Sequencer. Please remove the extra ‘04’ characters from the generated pubkey.
- **Description**: Brief introduction about you or your organization.

**Submission Steps**:

1. Fork the [metis-sequencer-resources](https://github.com/MetisProtocol/metis-sequencer-resources) repository.
2. Create a new branch and add your Sequencer details.
3. Submit a pull request for approval.

</Step>

<Step>

## Synchronize Your Node

### Wait for Sequencer Synchronization

Run the node and wait for block synchronization to complete:

1. Check the logs of the bridge container. Wait until the “`Waiting for themis to be synced`” message disappears, indicating that themis is synchronized to the latest height.
2. `Query eth_getBlockByNumber` via the Hyperion RPC to confirm the block height if it is synchronized to the latest.

Once both the Bridge and Hyperion Executor are fully synchronized, you can proceed with the lock operation.

<Callout type="warn">
  Note: Ensure synchronization is complete before proceeding. Continuing
  operations before synchronization is finished may result in lock events not
  being recognized.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

## Lock METIS Tokens

<Callout type="warn">
  The Metis tokens to be locked must be on Ethereum L1 (chainid:1)
</Callout>

You can complete the locking process through the [Sequencer Mining](https://sequencer.metis.io/) page. Alternatively, you can interact directly with the contract.

### Locking Options

You can lock METIS tokens using one of the following methods:

1. **Via Sequencer Mining Page**:
   - Access the user-friendly interface to complete the locking process directly through the [Sequencer Mining](https://sequencer.metis.io/) page.
2. **Direct Contract Interaction**:
   - For advanced users, bypass the frontend and interact directly with the smart contract.

### Wallet Whitelisting

Once your wallet address is added to the whitelist, you'll notice a **"Become a Sequencer"** button after connecting your MetaMask wallet. To initiate the process:

1. **Connect Your Wallet**: Ensure your MetaMask is connected to the Ethereum network.
2. **Start the Process**: Click the **"Become a Sequencer"** button to begin.

### Pre-Requisites

Before proceeding:

- **Minimum METIS Tokens**: Ensure your wallet holds at least **20,000 METIS** on the Ethereum mainnet.

### Node Setup

Set up your Sequencer node using Kubernetes for deployment. While Kubernetes is the recommended method for deployment, additional deployment options will be introduced in the future.

### Token Lock-Up

The lock-up process is a critical step for participating in the Sequencer Pool:

1. **Lock-Up Amount**:
   - Enter the amount of METIS tokens you want to lock, ensuring a **minimum of 20,000 METIS** and a **maximum of 100,000 METIS**.
2. **Confirm Transaction**:
   - Click **"CONFIRM"** to execute the lock-up transaction and confirm it in your wallet.

### Important Considerations

- **Lock-Up Cap**: The maximum lock-up amount is 100,000 METIS. Transactions exceeding this cap will still execute; however, rewards will be calculated based on the capped amount of 100,000 METIS.
- **Partial Withdrawals**: The functionality to partially withdraw locked tokens is not available yet. If you accidentally lock more than intended, you will need to exit and rejoin the Sequencer Pool. Note that there is a **21-day exit period**, during which rewards will not accrue.
- **Plan Carefully**: Only lock the amount of METIS you are comfortable with, keeping in mind the operational limits and restrictions.

### Completion

Once the lock-up process is complete and you see the **"Complete"** confirmation page, congratulations—your Sequencer setup is now successful, and you are ready to operate as part of the Metis Decentralized Sequencer Pool.

<Callout type="info">Rewards are capped at 100,000 METIS lock-up.</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  Withdrawals before the 21-day exit period are not allowed.
</Callout>
